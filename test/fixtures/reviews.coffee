  message: "This was my first time at a Cracker Barrel, and I am impressed with the prices. For $15 I was able to get a ribeye steak with mashed potatoes, green beans, and mac & cheese - not bad! The lemonade was extremely fresh, and the service was great. My steak was also cooked properly - medium rare.
        I also like how you can buy old fashioned candy - peppermint sticks (as well as other flavors), peppermint bark, etc. Everything was decorated and ready for Christmas; there was a bit of a nostalgic feeling as you entered the store to get to the restaurant. I would definitely come again!"
